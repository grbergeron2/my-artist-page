            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>‘grace b’ is a singer/songwriter currently based in New Orleans, Louisiana. With her warm vocal tone and timeless lyrics, she blends elements of indie pop, folk, and psychedelic jazz to create a dreamy atmosphere for her listeners. Her songs mirror her personality, balancing her softer acoustic side with her love for upbeat groovier tunes. ‘grace b’ is influenced by a wide range of artists including Julie London, Eloise, Lizzy Mcalpine, Men I Trust, and Clairo. Above all, ‘grace b’ seeks to express the beauty in authenticity and her journey on the adventure of life.

            Growing up in Houston, TX, ‘grace b’ fell in love with singing and soon became invested in learning how to play piano and guitar. At only 15, she began writing her own songs as a secret in her childhood bedroom and developed a passion for expressing her unique experience through music. In March of 2020, she released her first single “Coming of Age,” with her friend and collaborator Wil Brookhart. This sentimental indie pop track was a farewell to her former self and an embrace of exciting new beginnings on her journey to starting a life in a new city. Since moving to New Orleans, ‘grace b’ has been quietly developing a fresh sound and improving her craft while finishing up her education. With her newest release coming in the summer of 2023, she is excited to share her most authentic songs yet! </p>
